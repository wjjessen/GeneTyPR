# GeneTyPR

The Gene TyPR app (pronounced "Gene Typer", an acronym for Gene Type Parser) is a Shiny application developed as a Course Project for the Coursera Developing Data Products class.

Gene TyPR was designed to download the latest Homo sapiens gene information (updated nightly) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (part of the United States National Library of Medicine, a branch of the National Institutes of Health), analyze and display user-selected gene type data, and allow for export.

The Gene TyPR app has a tabbed interface that displays a barchart of the data (gene count per chromosome), a table summarizing the user-selected gene type gene count per chromosome, and a table providing gene details for the selected gene type. Both data tables can be exported.

Gene TyPR is avalilable at: https://wjjessen.shinyapps.io/GeneTyPR/

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on GitHub: https://github.com/wjjessen/GeneTyPR/
